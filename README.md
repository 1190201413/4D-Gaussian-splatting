# 4D-Gaussian-splatting
This is a unofficial implement of 4D Gaussian Splatting: Towards Efficient Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Scenes 
I have achieve almost thing that mentioned in paper，and achieve similar result on DNeRF dataset. 
But clone and split is implemented in pytorch

you need to install extension：
pip install simple-knn/

this extension is a new version ，different to first version
